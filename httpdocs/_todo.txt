1. Upload this folder to your server

2. Make sure the following file and folders can be written to by the web server:
   ./client.cue
   ./client.id
   ./config.php
   ./sounds/
   ./uploads/

3. Copy config.php.defaults to config.php. Then edit the values inside:
   - Set "NOUPLOAD" to true if you don't want users to be able to record new soundbites.
   - Put the URL for your online playlist (e.g. Festify's https://festify.us/party/???) between the quotes after "$PARTYURL = ".
     If the variable is empty, the landing page will be skipped.
   - Change the default password "party time excellent" to your preferred password for registering as remote playback client and removing soundbites.
