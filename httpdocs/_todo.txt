1. Upload this folder to your server

2. Make sure the following file and folders can be written to by the web server:
   ./client.cue
   ./client.id
   ./sounds/
   ./uploads/

3. Copy config.php.defaults to config.php. Then edit the values inside:
   - Change the default password "party time excellent" to your preferred password for registering as remote playback client and removing soundbites.
   - Put the URL for your online playlist (e.g. Festify's https://festify.us/party/???) between the quotes after "'partyUrl' =>".
     If the variable is empty, the landing page will be skipped.
   - Set "noUpload" to true if you don't want users to be able to record new soundbites.

If you're running this with a web server on the PC that will also do the remote playback:

1. Rename remoteplay.php.localplayback to remoteplay.php

2. Copy mpv.exe from http://mpv.io to this folder (direct downloads: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/release/)

3. Make sure the following file can be written to by the web server:
		/playback.log
