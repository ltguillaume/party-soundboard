2. Make sure the following file and folders can be written to by the web server:

3. In remove.php, change 'begone' to your preferred password for removing soundbites.

4. In index.htm, put the URL for your online playlist (e.g. Festify's https://festify.us/party/???) between the quotes after "partyUrl ="

5. Or rename soundboard.htm to index.htm to skip the landing page completely.
